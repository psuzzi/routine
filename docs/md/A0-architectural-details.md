# Routine App: Architectural Details

## Development Stages

### 1. Initial Prototype (Monolithic)

- Backend:
    - Spring Boot monolithic application
    - RESTful API endpoints
    - Single PostgreSQL database
    - Basic Spring Security for authentication

- Frontend:
    - React Single Page Application (SPA)
    - Basic state management (e.g., React Context or Redux)

- Mobile:
    - Not implemented in this stage

- CI/CD:
    - GitHub Actions workflow for building and testing
    - Manual deployment to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku)

### 2. MVP (Modular Monolith)

- Backend:
    - Refactor monolith into modules (e.g., TaskModule, CalendarModule)
    - Implement RabbitMQ for inter-module communication
    - Enhance security with OAuth 2.0 for Google Calendar integration

- Frontend:
    - Implement advanced state management
    - Add offline support using service workers

- Mobile:
    - Begin React Native development
    - Share code with web frontend where possible

- CI/CD:
    - Extend GitHub Actions to include automatic deployment
    - Implement staging and production environments

### 3. Scaling (Microservices)

- Backend:
    - Gradually split modules into microservices
    - Implement API Gateway (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway)
    - Use Docker for containerization
    - Consider introducing Kubernetes for orchestration

- Frontend:
    - Optimize for performance (code splitting, lazy loading)
    - Implement advanced caching strategies

- Mobile:
    - Full feature parity with web application
    - Platform-specific optimizations

- CI/CD:
    - Implement blue-green deployments
    - Automate database migrations
    - Set up monitoring and alerting

## Detailed Architecture

### Backend

1. Core Services:
    - UserService: Manage user accounts and authentication
    - TaskService: Handle todo items and task management
    - CalendarService: Manage calendar events
    - SyncService: Integration with external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar)

2. API Layer:
    - RESTful APIs for CRUD operations
    - GraphQL API for more complex data fetching (optional)

3. Database:
    - PostgreSQL for structured data (users, tasks, events)
    - Consider Redis for caching frequently accessed data

4. Message Queue:
    - RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication between services

5. Authentication:
    - OAuth 2.0 with JWT for secure authentication
    - Integration with Google OAuth for calendar sync

### Frontend (Web)

1. React SPA:
    - Component-based architecture
    - React Router for navigation
    - Redux or MobX for state management

2. API Integration:
    - Axios or Fetch for API calls
    - Apollo Client if using GraphQL

3. Offline Support:
    - Service Workers for caching
    - IndexedDB for local data storage

4. UI/UX:
    - Responsive design using CSS-in-JS or Sass
    - Accessibility considerations (WCAG compliance)

### Mobile (React Native)

1. Shared Logic:
    - Reuse business logic and state management from web frontend

2. Native Features:
    - Push notifications
    - Calendar integration
    - Offline data sync

3. Platform-specific UI:
    - Implement native UI components where necessary

### DevOps & CI/CD

1. Version Control:
    - Git repositories on GitHub

2. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions):
    - Lint and format check
    - Unit and integration tests
    - Build artifacts
    - Security scans
    - Deployment to staging/production

3. Containerization:
    - Docker for consistent environments
    - Docker Compose for local development

4. Cloud Deployment:
    - Options:
      a) AWS (ECS/EKS for containers, RDS for database)
      b) Google Cloud (GKE, Cloud SQL)
      c) Azure (AKS, Azure Database for PostgreSQL)

5. Monitoring and Logging:
    - Options:
      a) ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
      b) Prometheus and Grafana
      c) Cloud-native solutions (CloudWatch, Stackdriver)

## Security Considerations

1. Data Encryption:
    - HTTPS for all communications
    - Encryption at rest for sensitive data

2. Authentication:
    - JWT with short expiration
    - Refresh token rotation

3. Authorization:
    - Role-based access control (RBAC)
    - Fine-grained permissions for collaborative features

4. API Security:
    - Rate limiting
    - Input validation and sanitization
    - CORS configuration

5. Dependency Management:
    - Regular updates of dependencies
    - Automated vulnerability scanning

## Scalability Considerations

1. Horizontal Scaling:
    - Stateless services for easy replication
    - Load balancing (e.g., Nginx, Cloud load balancers)

2. Caching:
    - Implement caching at various levels (API, database, application)
    - Consider using a distributed cache (e.g., Redis)

3. Database Optimization:
    - Indexing and query optimization
    - Consider read replicas for heavy read workloads

4. Asynchronous Processing:
    - Use message queues for time-consuming tasks
    - Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations

## Future Considerations

1. Internationalization (i18n):
    - Prepare the application for multi-language support

2. Machine Learning Integration:
    - Implement ML models for task prioritization or scheduling suggestions

3. Analytics:
    - Integrate analytics for user behavior tracking and app performance

4. API Versioning:
    - Plan for future API changes and backwards compatibility

This architecture provides a roadmap for developing the Routine App from a prototype to a scalable, production-ready application. 
Adjust the details as needed based on specific requirements and constraints encountered during development.
